# puzzled

This is a silly POC ERC20 puzzle solving game, the aim is to complete each of the sliding puzzles, but before playing a use needs to purchase PTokens which are used to play the game and each gameplay costs 500 PTokens. The other game is called amazeng which is another puzzle solving game but this time it uses token streaming to reward the user for having played the game the token used is the PToken

### How it works (Puzzled)
