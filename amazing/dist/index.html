        <h1>How to Play</h1>
        <p>To Play th Simply traverse through the different level mazes using rodger the alien
        </br> As a reward you collect coins which rodger can use  and are then streamed to you whenever you feel like you have had enough playtime
        The duration of the stream is determined by the time attached to each coin when you collect this is also shown at the top of the screen.
        You have a limited amount of time to complete a level maze so the coins you collect also add time to your exisiting level time which is carried over throughout all levels
